A collection of open-source Unity3D 4+ property drawers

http://blogs.unity3d.com/2012/09/07/property-drawers-in-unity-4/
http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/PropertyDrawer.html

Each directory contains one drawer, and some documentation.

New pull requests should be in this format:

```
AttributeName
 |- Editor
     |- PropertyDrawer.cs
 |- Attribute.cs
 |- ExampleUsage.cs
 |- readme.md
```

If you can embed pictures in your readmes, all the better.
